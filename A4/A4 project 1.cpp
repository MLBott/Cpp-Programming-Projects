This program manages a list of up to ten players and their high scores. It uses two arrays,
one for players and one for their scores. It uses a menu in the main fuction to allow adding
a player and their score, deleting a player and their score, printing out all scores, checking
a specific player's score, or exiting the program. If a player is not found the program tells
the user.*/
